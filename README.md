<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## NFSU M.Sc. Cyber Security Study Material

This is a compilation of all the study material you would require.<br />
This repository would periodically update with newer material, so star it or watch it.<br />
I mainly created this for juniors in the course, but everyone is welcome to follow and learn along.<br />
I hope this helps you as it helped me.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you are a junior referring these materials, i would highly recommend you to start with **P5**, due to Unit 4 and 5 within it.<br />
Most of the students in Sem 1 have difficulty in the following subjects: P5, P4, P2, P1, P3 ; in order of most tough to least tough subjects.<br />
As such, i would advice P5 to be completed first before going to other subjects.<br />
For P3 and P1, i would ask that you study my question bank as that covers most of the syllabus.
